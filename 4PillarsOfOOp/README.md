# 💻 4 Pillars of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is based on **objects** that contain data and behavior.  
It helps create **modular, reusable, and organized code**.  

---

## 1. 🧬 Inheritance
Inheritance allows a **child class to acquire properties and methods from a parent class**.

- Reduces code duplication
- Enables code reuse
- Supports hierarchical relationships

## 2. ⚡ Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows different objects to be treated as their parent type,
and the correct overridden method runs automatically.

- Achieved using virtual in parent and override in child
- Keeps Main clean
- Enables dynamic behavior

##3. 🛡 Encapsulation

Encapsulation is hiding internal data and exposing only what’s necessary.

- Protects data integrity
- Keeps code modular
- Achieved via private, protected, public

## 4. 🎭 Abstraction

Abstraction hides complex implementation details and exposes only essential features.

- Focuses on what an object does, not how
- Achieved via abstract classes or interfaces
