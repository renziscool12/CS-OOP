## Why Encapsulation?

- Better control of class members (reduce the possibility of yourself (or others) to mess up the code)
- Fields can be made read-only (if you only use the get method), or write-only (if you only use the set method)
- Flexible: the programmer can change one part of the code without affecting other parts
- Increased security of data
